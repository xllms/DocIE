# XLLM @ ACL 2025 Shared Task: Universal Document-level Information Extraction (DocIE)


We introduce the Universal Document-level Information Extraction (DocIE) challenge on this platform. The goal of DocIE is to identify entities, their corresponding mentions, and the relationships between entity pairs within long, unstructured documents. This challenge requires models to process an input document, which consists of a sequence of sentences, and produce output structures that include three key elements: 1) sets of mentions, where each set corresponds to a distinct entity; 2) entity types; and 3) relation triples, which describe the relationships between pairs of entities.
