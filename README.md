# XLLM @ ACL 2025 Shared Task: Universal Document-level Information Extraction (DocIE)


We propose the Universal Document-level Information Extraction challenge on the this platform. DocIE aims to detect entities, the mention of the entities and relations from document-level corpus at the same time. Therefore, the DUIE is defined as: Given a paragraph consisting of a series of sentences, the goal is to extract structured information comprising four elements: 1) the entities type, 2) the relation triples.
